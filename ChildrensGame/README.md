HTML/JavaScript programming test for a job application.

Spec:

Consider the following children’s game:
 

·         n children stand around a circle. 

·         Starting with a given child and working clockwise, each child gets a sequential number, which we will refer to as it’s id. 

·         Then starting with the first child, they count out from 1 until k. The  k’th child is now out and leaves the circle. The count starts again with the child immediately next to the eliminated one.

·         Children are so removed from the circle one by one. The winner is the  last child left standing.


As part of your solution: 

·         Create a standalone HTML page (i.e., not connecting to any server, or using any server side code)

·         use JavaScript, CSS and any other web-based technologies/libraries that you like (except Flash! :-) 

·         provide a means for the user to supply the inputs (n and k), and display an animated visual representation of the running game, and the final result (both the order of eliminated children and the winner)

·         provide a test harness to validate your solution.
